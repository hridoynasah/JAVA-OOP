Abstract Method: A method which contain abstract modifier at the
time of declaration is called abstract method.
Note :
i) It can only be used in abstract class
ii) It doesn't contain any body "{}" and always ends with ";" semicolon.
iii) Abstract Method must be overridden in subclass otherwise it will
otherwise it will also become a abstract class.
iv) Whenever the action is common but implementation are different
then we should use abstract method.

# Interface : Interface is just like a class, which contains
only abstract method.

To achieve interface java provides a keyword call implements.
Note :
i) Interface methods are public & abstract.
ii) Interface variable are by default public static final.
iii) Interface method must be overridden inside the implement.
iv) Interface nothing but deals between client and developer.

# CodeF : Interface
# CodeG : Interface
# CodeH : Why interface variables are public static and final in Java?
# CodeI : Why interface methods are abstract?
If I create two method in interface, I have to implement both.
Otherwise it become abstract class.
