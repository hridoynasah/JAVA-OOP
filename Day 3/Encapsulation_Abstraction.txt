# Encapsulation: Encapsulation is a mechanism through which
we can wrap data and members and method members of class in
a single unit is called Encapsulation. allows data hiding.
Note: i) Class variable must be private.
      ii) Declare the class method as a public.
Example: Class is the best example of encapsulation.

# Abstraction : Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation
details from the users, only the highlighted set of services provided
to the users.
Advantage: i) Security.
           ii) Enhancement.
Implement: i) Abstract Class. ii) Interface.

# Abstract class: A class which contains the abstract keyword in its
declaration is called abstract class.
Note:
i) Can't create abstract class. but can create reference variable
for abstract class.(Reference would be of super class & Object would be of sub-class)
ii) It may or may not contain abstract method.
iii) It can have abstract or non-abstract methods.
iv) To use an abstract class, you have to inherit form sub-class.
v) If a class contain partial implementation then we should declare
a class as abstract class. (Cause we can't create object of an abstract class.)
