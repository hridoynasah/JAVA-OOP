Default Constructor: A constructor which does not have any parameter
is called default constructor.
Parameterized Constructor: A constructor through which we can pass
one or more parameters is called parameterized constructor.
Copy Constructor: Whenever we pass object reference to the constructor
to the constructor then it is called a copy constructor.
