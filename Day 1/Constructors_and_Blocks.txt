#1.Default Constructor: A constructor which does not have any parameter
is called default constructor.

#2.Parameterized Constructor: A constructor through which we can pass
one or more parameters is called parameterized constructor.

#3.Copy Constructor: Whenever we pass object reference to the constructor
to the constructor then it is called a copy constructor.

#Copy Constructor copies one object's contents to another.

4.Private Constructor: Private and default can't be created together.

# Static Block: It is such kind of block in java which gets executed
at the time of loading the .class file into JVM memory.Execute before
instance block.

Instance Block: Instance block is similar to method which has no
name, it can be written inside a class only but not inside a method.
### Can't access without creating object. Because it is part of an object.
Note: i) It always executed before the constructor.
     ii) We can use only variables inside the instance block.
    iii) We write time the consuming code inside  instance block
         like - JDBC Connectivity.
